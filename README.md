# Bitwise Operations Practice Test for PCEP-30-02 Exam

This repository contains a **40-question multiple-choice test** designed to help you practice bitwise operations in Python. The test includes questions that combine bitwise operations with arithmetic operators to test operator precedence, as well as a few scenarios with errors (`NameError`, `ValueError`, `SyntaxError`, etc.) as the PCEP exam likes to mix these up a bit.


## Test Structure

- **Number of Questions:** 40
- **Question Type:** Multiple choice with 4 possible answers
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Basic bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `~`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`)
  - Combining bitwise operations with arithmetic/logic operators
  - Operator precedence with bitwise operations
  - Handling Python errors (e.g., `NameError`, `ValueError`)
  - Variable assignments and calculations with bitwise operations
  - Scenarios using conditional statements and loops
